Instructions :

- open file Kangoorun.pde with processing 2 software
- hit run button

Hit space bar and jump to avoid obstacles

If you can build yourself some arduino-based system
that can send "ON" and "OFF" string messages through
a serial connection, then you can build your own
kangoorun game controller which will allow you to
trigger jumps by jumping on some flat switch.

You can modify the look of the game by creating and
loading your own graphics.
Just drop them in the data folder and modify
the GameConfig.pde file accordingly.
